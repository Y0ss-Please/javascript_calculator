# javascript_calculator
On screen calculator assignment from The Odin Project curriculum.

I tried to make it behave and look as much like a physical calculator as possible.

Features:
- You can chain equations together by selecting on operator rather than the equals key.
- Selecting an operator after the solution is displayed applies that operator to the solution.
- Hitting equals with a blank constant assumes the previous constant. eg: '8 x null' is '8x8'.
- Hitting equals after the soultion repeats the operation on the solution.
- All numbers limited to ten digits. Solutions in excess are converted to exponential notation.
- Has an invert key for negative values.
- Works with decimals.

Thanks.
